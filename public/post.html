          <p>It was arguably the biggest manhunt in New York City history, and it climaxed with a spectacular standoff straight out of a Hollywood gangster flick.</p>
          <p>In February 1955, all 20,000 NYPD cops given “shoot to kill” orders went on a desperate search for a wily hitman-for-hire who’d eluded and embarrassed the department for days. When the chase was finally over, two detectives lay wounded, an East Harlem tenement was ablaze, and a bullet-riddled gunman named August Robles had made good on his vow that he’d never be taken alive.</p>
          <p>The twisted tale actually began months earlier in Baltimore with a totally unrelated crime committed by a bumbling gang of dishonorable crooks.</p>
          <p> In September 1954, two men invaded the home of a local numbers runner, believing the place was loaded with cash. As the robbers bound and gagged his wife, the runner emerged from another room with his pistol blazing, grazing one of the holdup men in the back.</p>
          <p>The wounded man, a Brooklynite named Joseph Aronowitz, was busted at the hospital and promptly starting singing to cops. Several co-conspirators were soon hauled in, including mastermind Martin Yamin, an ex-con who also happened to be a former police magistrate.</p>
          <p>The story might have ended there and remained a long-forgotten Baltimore crime — except that five months later, Aronowitz was one dead canary.</p>
          <center><img src="img/article.jpg" ></center>
          <p>On Feb. 15, 1955, the eve of Yamin’s trial in Baltimore, NYPD patrolmen found the 40-year-old Aronowitz, an ex-con who’d done time for narcotics, slumped behind the wheel of his car in Brooklyn with two slugs in his head.

            It was an obvious rubout meant to keep Aronowitz from testifying. Yamin, who now lived in Manhattan, was brought in as a material witness while investigators searched for the thugs who’d taken Aronowitz for a fatal ride.</p>
            <p>Two days later, they knew the identity of the likely triggerman: August Robles, a career criminal. A detective who knew him described him as one of the most “vicious and dangerous killers around,” adding Robles had told a pal that “any cop who tries to get me, I’ll shoot. The only way they’ll take me is dead.”</p>
            <p>A resident of what was then called Spanish Harlem, the 44-year-old Robles hardly looked the part of a bloodthirsty button man. Short, wiry and cursed with bad eyesight, he sported a perpetual squint behind thick eyeglasses.

              His criminal record dated to 1927, when he was a pistol-packing 14-year-old delinquent. After a reform school stint for assault and robbery, he graduated to the Big House, serving 17 years in Clinton prison for carrying burglar tools and a gun. By the time he was paroled in 1949, Robles was a hardened ex-con who quickly built a rep as a tough guy who’d do any job — maybe even murder — for bargain-basement prices.</p>
              <p>Robles, it later turned out, had been hired by Yamin to shut Aronowitz up for the tidy sum of $300.

                Three days after Aronowitz was killed, a trio of detectives traced Robles to his girlfriend’s place on E. 104th St. and grabbed him without a struggle. But the elated cops did a bad job of frisking the suspect. As they walked Robles out of the apartment, he pulled an automatic pistol and got the drop on them.</p>
                <p>The red-faced policemen reluctantly handed over their .38 revolvers and watched as Robles scampered away.

                  Hours later, Robles gave the department another black eye. On a hunch, a 104th Precinct detective named Frank Malerba who knew Robles grabbed three colleagues and rushed to an apartment in the St. Nicholas Houses on W. 129th St. where the gunman’s niece lived.
                  
                  But the quarry outfoxed his hunters yet again. Hiding in a stairway, Robles exchanged fire with police and made his second daring escape in one day.</p>
                  <p>Humiliated officials scrambled to mount a citywide dragnet for the elusive, squint-eyed killer, whom the Daily News gleefully dubbed “4 Guns” Robles — a reference to the three pistols he stripped from police in addition to his own.</p>
                  <p>The city’s entire police force was instructed to “shoot to kill” the pint-sized perp if necessary, and dozens of overzealous citizens started calling in sightings, leading cops to search dozens of subway stations, movie theaters and city parks with no luck.

                    Robles actually hadn’t gone far. Bleeding from a cop’s bullet that grazed his neck during the second escape, he headed to another relative’s apartment on E. 112th St. in East Harlem and barricaded himself in after forcing family members to flee.</p>
                    <p>After a reliable tip that he was hiding right under their noses, more than 200 patrolmen, detectives and emergency service officers surrounded the building — as thousands of neighborhood residents leaned out windows, stood on fire escapes and ran to nearby rooftops to watch the drama unfold.</p>

                    <p>Malerba, one of the detectives who had exchanged fire with Robles the day before, led a small band of policemen to the fourth floor flat where he was holed up.</p>
<p>They broke down the door and ordered Robles to drop his weapons and walk out backwards — only to be met with a defiant volley of bullets. Two detectives were hit, one of them sustaining a serious leg wound.

  From the adjoining rooftop dozens of cops armed with Thompson machine guns, rifles, shotguns and pistols returned fire, pumping hundreds of rounds into the apartment. Another order to surrender was followed by Robles’ angry retort: more hot lead.
  
  It went on like that for nearly two hours — with onlookers jeering cops and cheering the criminal whenever he returned fire.</p>
  <p>At one point, cops’ misguided attempt to smoke Robles out with tear gas grenades instead started a fire in the apartment, and the gun battle was put on pause as firemen on ladders battled the blaze to save the building.</p>
